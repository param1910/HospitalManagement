        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Joint Replacement Surgery</span><br><br>Offered by best ortho hospitals in India, joint replacement surgery is a procedure in which parts of a damaged joint are replaced with prosthesis. The prosthesis is usually made from metal, ceramic or plastic. It easily replicates the movement of a healthy joint. Joint replacement surgery is performed on knee, hip, wrist, ankle, elbow and shoulder. The most commonly performed ones include hip and knee replacements.

        Numerous conditions can lead to joint pain and disability and cause patients to think about undergoing a joint replacement surgery. In many cases, damage to the cartilage causes joint pain. This damage can be either from arthritis, fracture, or any other condition. When non-surgical treatments like medication, change in lifestyle and physical therapy do not offer any relief in the condition, the doctor may recommend joint replacement surgery.
        <br><br>Before the surgery, the doctor will explain the patient about potential risks and complications of total joint replacement, including those related to the surgery itself and those that can occur after the surgery. Joint replacement surgery takes a few hours. During the surgery, the damaged or injured cartilage and bone is detached from the joint and substituted with prosthetic components made of ceramic, plastic, or metal. The prosthesis works like a normal joint and mimics its shape and movement. Regular exercise is an important part of the recovery process. The doctor or physical therapist will provide the patient with specific exercises to help restore movement and strengthen the joint.
        <br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Total Knee Replacement Surgery</span><br><br>If a patient’s knee is sternly damaged by arthritis or because of any injury, it may be difficult for them to perform everyday activities, such as climbing stairs or walking. After a period, they may even begin to feel pain while sitting or lying down. When non-surgical treatments like use of walking supports and medications prove no longer to be helpful, the doctor may advise the patient to undergo a total knee replacement surgery. It is a safe procedure that helps in pain relief, corrects leg deformity and helps the patient resume normal activities. <br><br>Also known as knee arthroplasty, total knee replacement surgery is offered only in the best hospitals in Delhi. There are four steps to a total knee replacement surgery. These steps include preparation of the bone, positioning the metal implants, resurfacing the patella and inserting a spacer. Before a total knee replacement surgery is performed, Orthopeadics do an evaluation of the medical history, conduct a physical examination, X-rays and other tests like MRI and blood tests. The doctor then reviews the results and discusses with the patient if total knee replacement surgery is the best option in their case to improve function and relieve pain. Other treatment options include physical therapy, medications, injections and other types of surgery.

        Diligently following the surgeon's instructions after the procedure and taking care of the knee replacement and general health are important and necessary to contribute to the success of the total knee replacement surgery.</p>
